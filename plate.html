        <p>Generally plates are raised round the edges, either by a curving up, or a wider lip or raised portion. Vessels with no lip, especially if they have a more rounded profile, are likely to be considered as bowls or dishes, as are very large vessels with a plate shape. Plates are dishware, and tableware.</p>

        <p>We have 50 sets of black plates and 60 sets of any other sets of plates showed above. The sooner you order, the better.</p>
