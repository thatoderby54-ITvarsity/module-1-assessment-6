        <p>The lowball glass, Old Fashioned glass, or rocks glass, are all names for a short tumbler with a solid base which holds around 6 to 8 ounces of liquid. A solid base aids with drinks that require 'muddled' ingredients. These low glasses can also be used for serving a neat pour of liquor..</p>
        <p>A wine glass is a type of glass that is used to drink and taste wine. Most wine glasses are stemware, that is they are goblets composed of three parts: the bowl, stem, and foot</p>
        <p>We have 50 sets of alcohol glass, 20 sets of round glass and 80 sets of wine glass. The sooner you order, the better.</p>
